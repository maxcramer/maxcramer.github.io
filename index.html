        <section id="about">
          <p>
            My interest into web development was recently perked, as previously I had a vegan & vegetarian delivery service with a friend and had yearned for those skills. Having grown up enjoying building websites using online templates, being fascinated by both the programing behind it as well as a love for art and creativity, I decided to grow my skills in web development at General Assembly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web development as a career excites me due to the scope of ability to move up within an organisation. I also firmly believe that being able to learn and further those skills while working is a huge bonus that I have not seen in many industries before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideally, I would be working within a close-knit, friendly and patient development team, which would allow me to grow my skills over a long term basis. My dream company would be an ethical one that would help increase people's standard of living or health.
